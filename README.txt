RESPONSIVE MENUS
----------------
Responsify your menus! Just give me a CSS selector of your menu and
I will make it mobile friendly (when the time is right).

CONFIGURATION
-------------
For many use cases, the default settings will be enough.  Turn it on = done.
I am a huge fan of 0-config, too many things to configure in Drupal already.
That said, there are plenty of configuration options at:
/admin/config/user-interface/responsive_menus

These options include:
-CSS selectors for which menus to responsify
-Responsive menu style (will include nifty 3rd party solutions later)
-Screen width to respond to
